# LinkedList
This code is a Python implementation of a linked list data structure. It includes a class for a node and another class for the linked list, with methods for adding, deleting, and traversing nodes. This code can be useful as a reference for implementing linked lists in Python.


This code is an implementation of a linked list data structure in Python. It includes a class Stud that represents a node in the linked list and another class StudList that represents the entire linked list. The Stud class has two attributes - roll and name - that store the roll number and name of a student respectively. The StudList class has several methods to perform different operations on the linked list, such as appendstart, appendlast, insert_position, delete_first, deletelast, and delete_position.

The main program prompts the user to enter the details of several students and adds them to the linked list using the appendlast method. It then performs various operations on the linked list such as appending a new node at the start and end, inserting a node at a specific position, deleting the first and last nodes, and deleting a node at a specific position. After each operation, the linked list is printed using the traverse method to show the updated list.

This code can be useful as a reference for implementing linked lists in Python and understanding the basic operations that can be performed on them.
